The above teaches about API design using node.js and express, like Glitch.

The above goes into the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js)

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13121590/steps-to-send-a-https-request-to-a-rest-service-in-node-js
https request used in my node.js app to get token from my website api

protocols used: MQTT (wia stream connect), HTTP (my app). TCP/IP protocols (Blynk).

Suggested improvements. As it stands, there is a single node app running on my rpi. It can only interact with
one Blynk app at a time. It would be good if an instance of the app could be executed on teh browser of teh client
using my glitch web app rather than on my pi. As a result of this, I hardcoded the wia app widget from my wia account. 
With each client executing their own instance of the app in browser, multiple users could use my web app simultaneously.
We haven't covered WAN servers in this course, nor creating node apps that are downloaded and executed in browser.
